PT_NULL
    The array element is unused and the other
    members' values are undefined.  This lets the
    program header have ignored entries.

PT_LOAD
    The array element specifies a loadable segment,
    described by p_filesz and p_memsz.  The bytes
    from the file are mapped to the beginning of the
    memory segment.  If the segment's memory size
    p_memsz is larger than the file size p_filesz,
    the "extra" bytes are defined to hold the value 0
    and to follow the segment's initialized area.
    The file size may not be larger than the memory
    size.  Loadable segment entries in the program
    header table appear in ascending order, sorted on
    the p_vaddr member.

PT_DYNAMIC
    The array element specifies dynamic linking
    information.

PT_INTERP
    The array element specifies the location and size
    of a null-terminated pathname to invoke as an
    interpreter.  This segment type is meaningful
    only for executable files (though it may occur
    for shared objects).  However it may not occur
    more than once in a file.  If it is present, it
    must precede any loadable segment entry.

PT_NOTE
    The array element specifies the location of notes
    (ElfN_Nhdr).

PT_SHLIB
    This segment type is reserved but has unspecified
    semantics.  Programs that contain an array
    element of this type do not conform to the ABI.

PT_PHDR
    The array element, if present, specifies the
    location and size of the program header table
    itself, both in the file and in the memory image
    of the program.  This segment type may not occur
    more than once in a file.  Moreover, it may occur
    only if the program header table is part of the
    memory image of the program.  If it is present,
    it must precede any loadable segment entry.

PT_LOPROC
PT_HIPROC
    Values in the inclusive range [PT_LOPROC,
    PT_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-specific
    semantics.

PT_GNU_STACK
    GNU extension which is used by the Linux kernel
    to control the state of the stack via the flags
    set in the p_flags member.

PT_GNU_EH_FRAME	 	
    The array element specifies the location and size of the exception handling information as defined by the .eh_frame_hdr section.

PT_GNU_STACK	     	
    The p_flags member specifies the permissions on the segment containing the stack and is used to indicate wether the stack should be executable. The absense of this header indicates that the stack will be executable.
